import axios from 'axios'
const baseURL = `http://localhost:3001/`

// Show all (Not sure if i need it for this specifically because 
//          it wont show anything just put it in 1 big databases made up of two small ones) 

//Show One (Only being used as a form and parsing through data from one big database to
//          two small databases)

//Edit (This only be changed in another api)

//Create (This one would most likely be the only one being used consistently 
//       because it is only a form )

//Delete (Same reasoning as the edit comment)
