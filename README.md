## Below What I am going to say has information about the Create React App 

Render Deployment - https://morningapp.onrender.com

## Introduction
Due to 5-6 days for a fullstack MERN application the application is not fully structured and not even styled correctly, by the lack of time to create a a front-end and a back-end but also testing and the application multiple times. 
The final product was a front end where it can interact with the database that is provided with however there error in code where there shouldn't be any errors whatsoever. As such it is a mismatch of an application.

# Technologies Used
-axios
-bootstrap (attempt)
-React.js
-Javascript
-Git
-Render (attempt)

# Getting Started
**Step 1: Clone (or fork) the repository**

Run the following code in your terminal to download the code:

**Step 2: Run NPM Install to install necessary packages**

# Unsolved Problems
The Food Database:
- The Show one route does work but the link to it doesnt
- The create does and then doesnt work (Has to be fixed)


The Wake Up Database
- The Show one route link works but the contents of the link doesnt show (The opposite of the Food Database problem)
- The same problem with the create route with the other database
- The edit route has similiar problems has the show one route

App
- The actual idea behind the app
- There was supposed to be a calendar no time whatsoever to actually structing and assign information to it.
- The pulling the information from the mongodb and also the render of the application on Render
# Future Enhancements
 
Fixing the Unsolved problems and then adding the Weather API above the supposed calendar

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
